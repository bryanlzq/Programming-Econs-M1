2016.10.03 - HW4 - Great job on the plot Bryan (lot's of people didn't
get that).

2016.10.25 - HW5 - Well done Bryan, but you forgot to put your function
             into another file. The only reason your function works is
             not because it is in the package but because you ran the
             code in R. You should save the function in a .R file in your
             package.
             HW6 - Hope the problems were useful. Was there anything else you
             would have preferred I cover in these questions?
