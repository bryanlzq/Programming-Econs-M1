Nice work. It was an interesting take on the problem setting p to be random. This made
your output unpredictable (of course) but was a neat idea. What would be the expected
wealth of playing a gamble whose probability of winning is unknown! That's tough, but
is related to a field in finance known as Robust Finance, where one tries to learn
about the model not knowing the distribution of risk. 

A few comments: you should work on naming your variables something more meaningful. K was
hard to figure out. Additionally, add comments (the more the merrier) to help me see
what you're doing and remind yourself later. Lastly, plotting is always good practice and
fun to see what you're getting from your simulation!

In any case, nice work.
